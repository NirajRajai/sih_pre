 travelling in surat bandra express.train number 12936. booked a ticket in fc where fair is more than ac chair car. but there is no ac available in the coaches. could someone from railway explain the logic behind charging almost 40% extra for a non ac coach.
 sirs may i expect compensation like u r charging penalties to wt persons n high charges are being charged in tq
 .sir!!..its unethical that during irctc booking the seat opnsr of fc and in reality its second seating bt price is of 1 ac .we r being cheated as fare is higher than car chair train no. 12936.media should highlight this "
 when a ticket is rac and two persons are traveling on one birth then don you think fair must be reduced to 50% or 40% ???? charging for one birth but giving half birth which is really very painful for a traveller.
